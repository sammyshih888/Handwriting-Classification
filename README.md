# Handwriting-Classification

## Purpose
Handwritten digits are currently labeled as distinct labels, yet there are cases in which digits can be seen in two different ways. I want to create a site where users can vote on what digit they see, creating a probability distribution to be used as training data for uncertain or fuzzy predictions. 

## Tasks
(1) Data collection - create a website where users can vote: https://sammyshih888.github.io/Handwriting-Classification/voting%20website/

(2) Use machine learning to build a classification engine based on collected data

(3) Data analysis - analyze ambiguous digits

## Issues/Improvements
- UI improvement on voting website - let users fill out more than 10 questions before submission
